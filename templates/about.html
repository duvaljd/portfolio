       <p class="description">When I'm not making something, you can find me enjoying <strong>video games</strong>; finding a quiet, tucked-away <strong>nature</strong> place; and/or bonding (i.e., playing fetch) with my pup, <strong>Apollo</strong>.</p>

      <div class="slide-content">
       <h5>The most important part of design is empathy.</h5>
        
       <p class="description">You'll never hear me refer to people as "users" because I'm always thinking about them beyond their interactions with an interface. I'm committed to using forward-thinking technology, beautiful design, and clear writing to empower people to accomplish good things. <strong>Considering people in context&mdash;who they are, what they care about, and what they want to do&mdash;is integral to effective design.</strong></p>
        
       <p class="description">I think <strong>a good designer always practices empathy</strong>. They dsicover people's needs (stated, observed, anticipated); take the time to understand the larger contexts in which people live, play, and work; and remain open to solutions that aren't always intuitive to themselves. Investing first and foremost in empathizing with people and their goals allows a designer to create <strong>solutions that accommodate people, rather than asking people to accommodate solutions</strong>&mdash;and these, I think, are most effective.</p>

											<p>The cirriculum of the English Honors Program challenged me to be an independent but empathic thinker; it gave me the tools to think critically about the world around me while also providing experience and frameworks for thinking through and across difference while identifying and managing my prejudices. These skills are the foundation on which all of my writing, design, and goals both professional and personal are built.</p>
